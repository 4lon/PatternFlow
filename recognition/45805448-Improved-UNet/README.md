# Image Segmentation of the ISIC dataset using Improved UNet

by Jaleel Abdur-Raheem, 458054448

## Introduction

### ISIC dataset

The ISIC challenge is a yearly event with the goal of developing imaging tools for diagnosis of skin cancer (i.e. melanoma). The challenge provides a dataset of coloured images of skin lesions, alongside a two-coloured mask (i.e. ground truth) dataset that labels where the lesion is in the image. The aim of this task is to create an algorithm that takes the image dataset and transforms it as close as it can to the mask dataset. This is known as image segmentation.

The [dataset used](https://isic-challenge-data.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/ISBI2016_ISIC_Part1_Training_Data.zip) and [relevant ground truths](https://isic-challenge-data.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/ISBI2016_ISIC_Part1_Training_GroundTruth.zip) come from the 2016 challenge, which had a much more reasonable downloading duration and size given the time constraints of the COMP3710 report.
