## Usage
#### Dependencies:
- matplotlib==3.4.3
- Numpy==1.19.5
- torchvision==0.10.0
- torch==1.9.0
- tqdm==4.62.1
- Pillow==8.4.0

To reproduce results using any dataset. Prepare dataset by structureing the data directory in accordance with torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder (https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/datasets.html). Modify data dir path in driver.ipynb and run all cells in order. \ 
Results may be volatile and vary with iterations. It is recommended to perform multiple independent runs of the notebook and selecting best performing models.
