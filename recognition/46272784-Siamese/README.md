# Siamese Network

## Architecture 
The Siamese Neural Network (SNN) is an artificial neural network that contains two (or more) parallel and identical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) which accept distinct inputs and produces embedding for the input. These embeddings are compared to generate a similarity score.
