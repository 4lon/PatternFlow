## Project Aims
This project aims to classify images of the brain from the ADNI dataset as either exhibiting Alzheimer's disease or not. This was implemented using a Visual Transformer (ViT) model, based on the architecture defined in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929.pdf "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale").
