1. The readme file should contain a title, a description of the algorithm and the problem that it solves (approximately a paragraph), how it works in a paragraph and a figure/visualisation.
2. It should also list any dependencies required, including versions and address reproduciblility of results, if applicable.
3. provide example inputs, outputs and plots of your algorithm
4. The read me file should be properly formatted using GitHub markdown
5. Describe any specific pre-processing you have used with references if any. Justify your training, validation and testing splits of the data.
