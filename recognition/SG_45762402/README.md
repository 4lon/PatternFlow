# StyleGan_Oasis

This project is an implementation of StyleGan based on the Oasis brain dataset.

Reference: https://github.com/rosinality/style-based-gan-pytorch.git

Original Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04948

## Dataset

The OASIS datasets hosted by central.xnat.org provide the community with open access to a significant database of neuroimaging and processed imaging data across a broad demographic, cognitive, and genetic spectrum an easily accessible platform for use in neuroimaging, clinical, and cognitive research on normal aging and cognitive decline. All data is available via [www.oasis-brains.org](https://www.oasis-brains.org/).s

## Requirements

- Python3

- Pytorch >= 1.0.0
- lmdb
- tqdm

## Usage

- ### Prepare the data

  ```
  !python prepare_data.py --out LMDB_PATH --n_worker N DATAPATH
  ```

  This step will generate a LMDB Dataset for training

- ### Training StyleGan

  To start train, use `path=LMDB_PATH`in train_stylegan.py.

  ```
  !python train_stylegan.py
  ```

  ### Generate Pictures

  Run generate_mixing.py , note that default parameters should be changed

  `size=64`
  `n_row=1`
  `n_col=5`
  `path=model.path`
  `mixing=True`
  `num_mixing=20`

  ```
  !python generate_mixing.py
  ```

- ### Train from pre-trained model

â€‹        To continue training from previous training -model ,change default `ckpt=pre-trained.model` in train_stylegan.py. 

- ### Some Generate Samples 

  #### 128*128 images

  <img src="./Images/size_128.png" width = "500" height = "280" alt="size128" align=center />

  

  #### 256*256 images

  <img src="./Images/size_256.png" width = "500" height = "280" alt="size256" align=center />
