# Generative Model of OASIS Brain Data using a VQVAE

This project uses a VQVAE to generate new images from the OASIS Brain dataset.

## Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder 
* what is the vqvae
  * 3 main parts
* what the resutls are (we use vwave to make reconstructions)
  [figure]
## Generating Images
* what is pixel CNN
  * what is the structure
  * what we use it for

## Application to OASIS brain dataset
### The data
* what is the dateset
* link
* example oasis brain image
  
### Training VQVAE
* [describe and justify trianing validation and test split] 
* training plots

### Results of VQVAE
* results of reconstructions
* results of reconstructions by epoch
* what ssim is
* value accuracy i got

### Training PixelCNN
* what data went in
* how made data
* [describe and justify trianing validation and test split] 
* training plots
* 
### Results of PixelCNN - Generated Images
* generatred iamges
* results of generation by epoch
* comments
