# Tensorflow Implementation of  Improved UNET

## Description 

### Google Colab

This model has been developed using Google Colab. Henceforth, all of the logic (such as mounting drives) assumes that setup. There are some preliminary steps if you would like to run it within that environment.

1. You will need to upload the dataset to your Google Drive, along with (optionally) model.py. This could take acouple of hours depending on your internet speeds.
2. You will also need to update the directory strings to be the relative location of your dataset

### Running on Personal Computer

If you would like to run this on your computer then please just do not run the first cell of main.ipynb. Everything else should work accordingly (as long as you update dataset paths)
