## Introduction
This [COMP3710](https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/course.html?course_code=comp3710) project in semester 2, 2021, is to build one of the most popular Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) - [StyleGAN](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Karras_A_Style-Based_Generator_Architecture_for_Generative_Adversarial_Networks_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf), for generating images of [OAI AKOA knee datasets](https://nda.nih.gov/oai/). StyleGAN was published in CVPR 2019, which is the top conference in the computer vision field. StyleGAN was originally designed to generate human faces with very high quality and variation. However, in this project, we utilise the StyleGAN for generating interesting medical imaging - OAI Accelerated Osteoarthritis knee (AKOA) datasets. Osteoarthritis in adults is one of the most common causes of disability. The OAI's objectives are to provide resources that help people better comprehend knee osteoarthritis prevention and treatment. Thus, generated AKOA images with good quality are likely to be helpful for medical researchers and doctors since they may find different but valuable insights from generated images. 

This project report includes mainly three sections: code implementation, methodology principles explanation, the experiment. The code is given with fully detailed inline comments in this repository. The methodology will talk about how the algorithm of StyleGAN works and why StyleGAN can achieve state-of-the-art results. In terms of the experiment, the experimental setting and implementation details will be described in detail. Also, the generated images will be presented at the end of this report.
