# Brain MRI Semantic Image Segmentation using improved u-net
## Introduction
For this project, I have built an improved Unet and performed image segmentation on the ISIC dataset, which are images of skin cancer. In this documentation, I will introduce the structure of the model, model training process and its results based on the model. 

## Model Architecture 
### Unet 
A Unet is a convolutional neural network which uses a U-shaped encoder-decoder
