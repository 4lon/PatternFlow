Task 5 Requirement: Implement a brain MRI super-resolution network by training on the ADNI brain dataset. Create down-sampled data (approximately by a factor of 4) using Tensorflow implementations. The network should be trained to up-scale from 4x down-sampled input and produce a â€œreasonably clear image".
