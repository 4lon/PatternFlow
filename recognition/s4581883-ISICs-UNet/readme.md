# Improved UNet Model for Segmented the ISICs Dataset
This task uses an improved UNet model which maintains the same convolutional neural network structure of a regular UNet, combined with dice loss functions to more suitably segment brain tumours. 



## Dependencies 
- Python 3.9.7
- Tensorflow 2.6.0
- Numpy 1.19.5
- Matplotlib 3.4.3
- ISIC 2018 Task 1 Dataset
