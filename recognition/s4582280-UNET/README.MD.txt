# Task
CSSE3710 - Semester 2 2022
1. Segment the ISIC data set with the Improved UNet with all labels having a minimum Dice similarity
coefficient of 0.8 on the test set. [Easy Difficulty]

# The Algorithm

## Description


## Usage

## Preprocessing
### Data Files
The data which is used for this project

## Dependencies
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- ISIC dataset files (placed into "Data" folder)

1. The readme file should contain a title, a description of the algorithm and the problem that it solves
(approximately a paragraph), how it works in a paragraph and a figure/visualisation.
2. It should also list any dependencies required, including versions and address reproduciblility of results,
if applicable.
3. provide example inputs, outputs and plots of your algorithm
4. The read me file should be properly formatted using GitHub markdown
5. Describe any specific pre-processing you have used with references if any. Justify your training, validation
and testing splits of the data.
