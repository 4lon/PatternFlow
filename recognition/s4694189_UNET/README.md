Project: Segmentation using UNet


Segmentation of ISIC data with improved UNet

This project develops a solution to the ISIC challenge using UNet. The objective of the project is to train convolutional neural network to segment the ISIC images using improved UNet. The architecture of improved UNet has been referred from F. Isensee, P. Kickingereder, W. Wick, M. Bendszus, and K. H. Maier-Hein’s “Brain Tumor Segmentation and Radiomics Survival Prediction: Contribution to the BRATS 2017 Challenge,” research paper. This paper gives the architecture of improved UNet. It consists of two parts: -
* Downsampling
* Upsampling

Following diagram exactly depicts the architecture
